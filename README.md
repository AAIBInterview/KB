4. Screen D : Payment gateway either by rewards or banking or CC or wallet ( can be simulated with default app wallet )
4. Screen E : Succesfull Transaction Details with unique voucher bar code to be generated and persisted locally ( Screen should contain share button upon click it should share with the person from screen B (phone contact) with a voucher widget by SMS or Whatsapp or FB messenger or email )

On All screen there should be common menu bar to navigate between screen and other profile screens, log out etc. 

you can use AirAsia Logo for branding.
